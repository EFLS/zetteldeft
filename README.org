#+author: EFLS

*Short*: this document contains all the source code to a set of functions for =emacs=, which aim to extend the =deft= package and turn it into a (very very) basic Zettelkasten note-taking system.

Introduction, documentation, and code can be found in this single =.org= file [[https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft/blob/master/zetteldeft.org][here]].
Or simply get the =zetteldeft.el= file and you're [[https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft/blob/master/zetteldeft.el][good to go]].

Want to read that in a more convenient format? Get it on [[https://efls.github.io/zetteldeft/][efls.github.io/zetteldeft]].
