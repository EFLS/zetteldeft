#+title: Contributing to Zetteldeft

Comments and contributions to Zetteldeft are more than welcome.

Reach out [[https://mastodon.social/@EFLS][via Mastodon]], file an issue over [[https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft][on Github]], or submit a pull request to get your code included.

If you want to contribute code, please keep in mind that Zetteldeft is maintained in the =zetteldeft.org= file.
The =zetteldeft.el= is then created from the =zetteldeft.org= -- or, in Org-mode jargon, "tangled".

Please respect this order of things if you can, by making changes to the =.org= file (rather than to the =.el= file directly).
Alter the code in the source blocks, or create new source blocks like so:

#+begin_src org-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "Code goes here")
#+end_src
#+end_src

You can add some documentation if you like, but this is not necessary.

If you run into any issue, don't hesitate to reach out.
